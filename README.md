# Enyata Landing Page Clone

This is a clone of the Enyata landing page created for practice purposes. The clone was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Purpose

The purpose of this clone is to practice building a landing page using modern web development tools and techniques. By creating this clone, I aim to improve my skills in front-end web development and gain a deeper understanding of Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS was chosen as the CSS framework for this project for the following reasons:

- **Rapid prototyping**: Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-defined utility classes, which makes it easy to quickly prototype and build custom user interfaces without writing custom CSS.
- **Maintainability**: Because Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework, it is easier to maintain and update styles as compared to traditional CSS frameworks where styles are defined in separate CSS files.
- **Flexibility**: Tailwind CSS allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization, which makes it a great choice for building complex user interfaces.
